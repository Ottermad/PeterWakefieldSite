    	<h1 class="Title">About the Author.</h1>
	<p>
		There is something unique about the power of the spoken and written word.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is something I discovered in the twenty five years that I was a priest in the Church of England.
	</p>
	<p>
		My name is Peter Wakefield, married to Christine, and I am now retired and living in Birmingham, England. I have four children and seven grandchildren.
	</p>
	<p>
		During the time I was in the ministry I must have written and delivered over two thousand sermons and talks. This challenged me to create many hundreds of new short stories.
	</p>
	<p>
		The feedback that came very consistently, month after month and year after year was that people easily forgot all the religious words I used, but remembered the stories. If I wrote a story in a parish magazine or newsletter I would often find myself having arguments in pubs and homes about the content. I never expected anyone to necessarily agree with me, but what was always encouraging was that I could tell they had read and thought about what I had written. I think this sowed the seeds to becoming a writer.
	</p>
	<p>
		I left the ministry in 1997, and for five years Chris and I lived in France, returning to England in 2011.
	</p>
	<p>
		This was the time when I found the confidence to start writing short stories, with the hope of getting them published.
	</p>

	<h2 class="Title">Writing.</h2>
	<p>
		Gradually this became something that I loved doing. I spent a lot of time using public transport; sitting in pubs and cafes, listening to conversations, and observing how people communicated with one another. (On many occasions how they never communicated at all). This gave me source ideas for a wide variety of new short stories.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have also attended some excellent writing courses, and as I said before was fortunate enough to win a writing holiday. These experiences together gave me the confidence to try short story writing
	</p>
	
	<h2 class="Title">Types of Story.</h2>
	<p>
		I make no apologies for the fact that some of my stories are drawn from the Bible. I have tried to take familiar stories, that even now people still know, and write them from a different viewpoint. The first example of this is the opening story, entirely fictitious, about the wife of one of the shepherds. This is an expertise that I hope to go on developing.
	</p>
	<p>
		I hope that these stories can be enjoyed for their own sake. I hope also that they may help readers to think through in a new way what they may only vaguely remember.
	</p>
	<p>
		Many of the stories have nothing to do with religion whatsoever. They draw from the everyday life. I try to use my imagination to draw in the reader. On the street corner near my home we have yellow grit bin, which is filled each winter to salt the roads. This gave me the idea for 'Gritty Bin'. Some who have read this already are not sure if this is a children's story, or one for adults. The possibilities are endless.
	</p>
	
	<h2 class="Title">The Road Ahead.</h2>
	<p>
		I would never claim in any way to be a successful or confident writer yet. It is my hope that if this website develops, by its interactivity, I can learn from the readers insights and knowledge. It is also my great hope that readers will be able to learn from one another.
	</p>
	<p>
		Time will tell.
	</p>
